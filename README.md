The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted nearly everyone across the globe, and it's left many asking "how can I help?".  Our response to that question was to build a dedicated series of visualizations that capture important information about the spread and prevalence of COVID-19 in Wisconsin.  These tools have been used by state officials, health officials&mdash;including leaders at Gundersen and Marshfield Health Systems&mdash;and interested modelers to see which areas of Wisconsin are being affected most by COVID-19.  This effort stems from [AFI DSI COVID-19 Research Group](https://datascience.wisc.edu/covid19/), which has brought together researchers from UW-Madison and beyond to tackle data science issues relating to COVID-19.  

## Growth Rates 

Our primary visualization looks specifically at the growth rate of COVID-19 across Wisconsin metro areas as well as the prevalence of confirmed cases per thousand people.  It was inspired by visualizations created by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/upshot/coronavirus-metro-area-tracker.html).  Each visualization is interactive and allows the user to dig deep into the data that interests them.

This document is updated daily with new information and we regularly provide new summaries as the data is changing.
