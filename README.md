# COVID-19 in Wisconsin: How Fast It's Growing

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted nearly everyone across the globe, and it's left many asking "how can I help?".  Our response to that question was to build a dedicated series of visualizations that capture important information about the spread and prevalence of COVID-19 in Wisconsin.  These tools have been used by state officials, health officials&mdash;including leaders at Gundersen and Marshfield Health Systems&mdash;and interested modelers to see which areas of Wisconsin are being affected most by COVID-19.  This effort stems from [AFI DSI COVID-19 Research Group](https://datascience.wisc.edu/covid19/), which has brought together researchers from UW-Madison and beyond to tackle data science issues relating to COVID-19.  

## Growth Rates 

Our primary visualization looks specifically at the growth rate of COVID-19 across Wisconsin metro areas as well as the prevalence of confirmed cases per thousand people.  It was inspired by visualizations created by the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/upshot/coronavirus-metro-area-tracker.html).  Each visualization is interactive and allows the user to dig deep into the data that interests them.
